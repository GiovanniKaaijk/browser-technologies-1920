# OBA web-app on different browsers and devices

## Global / all devices
- No javascript</br>
    The application won't work on any device, since the whole app is about creating elements via javascript.
- No localstorage</br>
    You always get the tutorial when visiting the page, this works by localstorage
- No touchpad</br>
    The app does not work anymore. You can't drag and drop without a touchpad or mouse. You can only set the background color of the slide.

## Huawei p20 pro
Almost no issues, because it's a modern phone and chrome was up to date.
Dragging and dropping elements was a struggle.
